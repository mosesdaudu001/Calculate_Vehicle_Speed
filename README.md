# Calculate Vehicle Speed In Video

Hi my name is `Moses Daudu` 

In this repo, You will see how to calculate vehicles speed in a given video.

## Step 1:
Install all requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 2:
Edit the limit figures to be specific to your use case

## Step 3:
Run the `python` file
`python car_speed-detect.py`

### Side Notes:
1. I want to add the functionality to capture vehicles who move above a certain limit.
2. I want to dockerize this file
