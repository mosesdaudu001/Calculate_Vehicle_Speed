# Calculate Vehicle Speed In Video

Hi my name is `Moses Daudu` 

In this repo, You will see how to calculate vehicles speed in a given video.

## Step 1:
Install all requirements
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Step 2:
Edit the limit figures to be specific to your use case in line 28 and 29

## Step 3:
Run the `python` file


Contact Moses at `mosesdaudu001@gmail.com` for adjustments to suit your needs.

### Side Notes:
1. I would like to add masks to reduce compute resources.
2. I want to ensure that the time is calculated in a much more friendly way that assumes one frme is one second because i ran without GPU
3. I want to add the functionality to save the video and also capture vehicles who move above a certain limit.
4. I want to dockerize this file
